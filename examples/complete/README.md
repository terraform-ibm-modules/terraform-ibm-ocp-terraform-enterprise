## Overview

This repository provides a top-level Terraform module for deploying and managing HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise (TFE) on IBM Cloud Red Hat OpenShift clusters. The module automates the setup of namespaces, secrets, Helm releases, OpenShift routes, and supporting resources required for a production-grade TFE installation.

**Status:** This module is working but still incubating (alpha version). Interfaces and behaviors may change. Early adopters are encouraged to try it and provide feedback.
